modify .gitignore to include all SDL2 files in the last commit in order to see the files on github

    Is there another standard to specify which versions of libraries are in the project dependency list ?, I can think of "requirements.txt" in python, with pip, is there an equivalent in C dev ?
    + take notes on OneNote if I find the answer

Make a menu with 2D graphics instead of choosing level in the command line, in short, do everything to avoid having a command line interface in the final build

    If this is the case, don't forget to compile with -mwindows flag too
