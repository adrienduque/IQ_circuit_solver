6) Polishing project (proofreading comments, readme, release build) 

    make the readme based on the search_algorithm.c description, with visuals (game visual + tree visual)
    + before that, how the code is meant to be used (they can run showcase binaries on a windows 64-bit machine)
    if they are on another os, raylib 4.2 is needed, my code might be compatible between os, they just have to adapt the makefile, as I didn't feel like doing fancy things, but didn't tested it
    + example screenshot of each screen

Is there another standard to specify which versions of libraries are in the project dependency list ?, I can think of "requirements.txt" in python, with pip, is there an equivalent in C dev ?
    + take notes on OneNote if I find the answer

    -> Raylib 4.2
