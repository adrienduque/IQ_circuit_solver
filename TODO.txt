6) Polishing project (proofreading comments, readme, release build) 
    -> See other similar projects on github, how do they share their project ?
    do I try to include all the necessary .dll files with the final release or do I tell in the readme to install mingw dev tools to have the corresponding .dlls ?

    this is something to ask reddit / search through stackoverflow


    make the readme based on the search_algorithm.c description, with visuals (game visual + tree visual)

Is there another standard to specify which versions of libraries are in the project dependency list ?, I can think of "requirements.txt" in python, with pip, is there an equivalent in C dev ?
    + take notes on OneNote if I find the answer

    -> Raylib 4.2

Nailed it

    + is there an option to not launch a console when executing release app ?
